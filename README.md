### Project Overview

We built a game based on a space dodger type of game. You are driving a car and need to avoid obstacles by tilting the Tiva.

After a certain amount of time a RED LED turns on and you need to shake the Tiva.

If you shake the Tiva enough: The speed ot the game will remain unchanged, but you'll need to shake the Tiva a lot more
next time that the LED is turned on.

If you don't shake the Tiva enoguh: The speed of the game increases, but the shake difficulty wont increase.

The best score of the game is then stored in the EEPROM.
